// In an inter-college competition, various sports and games are played between different colleges like cricket, 
// basketball, football, hockey, lawn tennis, table tennis, carom and chess. The information regarding the games won
// by a particular college is stored in bit numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively of an integer variable 
// called game. The college that wins in 5 or more than 5 games is awarded the Champion of Champions trophy. If a number
// is entered through the keyboard, then write a program to find out whether the college won the Champion of the
// Champions trophy or not.
